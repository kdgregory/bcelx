[Apache Commons BCEL](http://commons.apache.org/bcel/) is a great tool for examining classfiles. Unfortunately,
it hasn't been updated since 2006, and the current released version doesn't support annotations. This project
is starting out as an annotation parser, because I need that for another project. I have some ideas of creating
a tree view on top of BCEL (with XPath-inspired searches), but that won't happen for a long time (if ever).
